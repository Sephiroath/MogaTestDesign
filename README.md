## So, A little bit of History, and some random justification:
I am a .NET Developer, but i've always beeen interested in Front End Development, i haven't really done this kind of exercise ever, so i think it might be a little dissapointing...

This is actually the first time ever i have worked with:
- **Media Queries**: I've seen them and i know what they do, but never really used them.
- **SASS**: I knew CSS preprocessors existed, but i hadn't even looked into them... they are Freaking Awesome(underused atm).
- **Flex**: Last time i checked it was really hard doing something remotely responsive without bootstrap (or a lot of code) i started the exercise without even knowing of Flex(not that i am an expert now)... guess i'll try checking CSS Grids when i have the time.

## Libraries/Frameworks Used:
- Angular 6
- Angular CLI
- Angular Material (for user Notifications)  
**Note** : 'Experimental Web Platform features' required to display backdrop-filter


## What do I know then?
Most times i have been given the html/css and i have modified it via JS most times with jQuery or libraries like Knockout, depending on the requirement, I'm a fast learner when it comes to programming so i don't find too much problem changing libraries :D (besides that i have implemented the back-end of the application with .NET(4.5+ or Core)).  
  
When it comes to Web UI i have always worked with libraries, some of them are:
- Bootstrap(3 been looking a little into 4)
- Foundation (Zurb)
- Materialize (not that much)  
And recently Angular Material.

## What have i been up to?
Lately i have really been looking into angular 2+ and its best practices... I actually wanted to implement Redux on this exercise... but it would take even longer (might do it later tho).

## Final Rant
Working with Text is quite hard...

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests
[NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
[NOT IMPLEMENTED YET]
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
